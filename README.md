# Some-result-data-and-process-document-for-HASM-iVQLS-and-HASM-HHL-experiments
In this repository, you can find:
1. ASCII file we used to get fig. 2 in the main text. They are the output of the classical HASM, HASM-iVQLS, and HASM-HHL, respectively.
2. When using HASM-iVQLS to solve the main equation, we used a segment of code that adds noise to the virtual machine and allows it to run.
3. When simulating the entire region using HASM-HHL, the raw result files obtained from solving the first 10 sub-computational areas with the virtual machine are provided. Throughout the experiment, we solved 3,604 similar sub-computational areas, and the result files are very similar. We have provided the first ten here for your reference.
