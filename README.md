# Some-result-data-and-process-document-for-HASM-iVQLS-and-HASM-HHL-experiments
In this repository, you can find:
1. ASCII files we used to get fig. 2 in the main text. In other words, documents named as `classic_jxtem.txt`, `hasmivqls_jxtem.txt`, `hasmhhl_jxtem.txt` are the output of the classical HASM, HASM-iVQLS, and HASM-HHL, respectively.
2. When using HASM-iVQLS to solve the main equation, we employed a segment of code (`set_hasmivqls.txt`). Although a `.cfg` file was used in practice, a `.txt` version is provided here as it is easier to read. This code introduces noise into the virtual machine and enables its execution.
3. When simulating the entire region using HASM-HHL, the raw result files obtained from solving the first 10 sub-computational areas with the virtual machine are provided (`10_output_hasmhhl.out`). Throughout the experiment, we solved 3,604 similar sub-computational areas, and the result files are very similar. We have provided the first ten here for your reference.
